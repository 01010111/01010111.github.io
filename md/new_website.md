# New Website!

You might not know by looking at it, but this is a new website! It shares some content with my previous one, but it has been built from scratch!

The previous website could be updated by authoring a pair of files - one `.md` file and one `.html` file. That was pretty convenient, but not convenient enough!

This version has only one `.html` file, and uses a URL query string to determine what `.md` file to load. This probably makes it really tough for bots to crawl my site, but I'm ok with that :)

This version fulfills several desires I've had for a personal website for a long time:
- hosted statically (and free) on github
- updated solely by authoring and editing markdown files
- no building!

If you'd like to see how it works, you can check out the [source on github](https://github.com/01010111/01010111.github.io)!
