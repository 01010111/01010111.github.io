# Inktober 2019

I've never participated in hashtag inktober before - it's a huge undertaking where an artist will complete an illustration every day in october and post it on social media. Of course saying it's a huge undertaking is just an excuse not to participate because you could always just doodle something in 15 seconds and submit it (but let's be honest our egos prevent us from sharing underdeveloped art).

Regardless, even though I now have six month old twins, I decided to give it a shot this year - with a huge caveat: I won't be making illustrations, but physically taking notes with pen and paper on gamedev ideas. I used to take these kind of notes a lot, especially before I started doing game dev. For the past several years I've sort of adopted a "why take notes when I can just start making a game?"

I still stand by that for the most part - I get so much more value by just _doing_ gamedev than writing about it. But with a full time job, and two screaming babies at home, the amount of time I have to develop my own games is extremely limited. This means that a lot of ideas fizzle out almost immediately after they pop in my head.

I thought that by writing down these ideas, not only do I codify them in a way that will allow me to come back to work on them when I _do_ have time, but I also get a little mental exercise by working out these ideas in a medium that I hardly ever use anymore - pen and paper!

Here we are on November 1, and I have to say - even though I failed stupendously by only completing 12 out of 31 inktobers - I was totally right! It was nice to just take 5 minutes every now and then to sit with an idea and write some notes. It didn't negatively affect my day job or my duties as a parent, and in some cases it helped the creation of some of the ideas because I had already "created" them in my mind to some extent - it almost felt like I was remixing an old idea when taking the idea to code rather than poking around in the dark. Maybe I should take more notes, write more design documents, and spend more time outside of the computer? Nah.

Anyway, I thought I'd spend this blog post talking about some of these ideas and how they evolved from brain to paper to code.
