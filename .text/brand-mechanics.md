# Playing the Brand: Crafting Engaging Game Mechanics Beyond Visuals
## With Unboxed Technology

In 2021, Unboxed Technology presented a compelling challenge: to translate their core concept of "Skill Agility" – the ability to rapidly develop new skills in response to change – into an engaging interactive experience. As specialists in professional training solutions, empowering their clients' employees to adapt and thrive in dynamic environments is central to their mission.

This wasn't just an assignment; it was an invitation to move beyond the superficial application of brand guidelines. How could we transcend fonts and color palettes to create a game that truly embodies the essence of Unboxed Technologies and resonates with their audience?

My background in the intense, rapid-fire creativity of game jams – nearly a hundred games under my belt, with several earning first-place finishes – has honed my ability to find the core mechanic within a given constraint. For a game jam, it's a theme like "Limited Space"; for a brand, it's the underlying feeling and core message. The question is always: what gameplay mechanic can evoke that feeling, providing players with an "Ah-ha!" moment that connects the experience directly to the central idea? This is where the unique power of games truly shines.

I had several ideas when considering Unboxed Technology' "Skill Agility" - the words immediately evoke a lot of video game related ideas - but the one idea I kept coming back to was a simple arcade-style game where the player's abilities would constantly be changing, and obstacles and hazards on the screen would be changing as well. The idea not only felt like a fount of extremely fun gameplay, but it perfectly mirrored users engaging with the training programs - keep up with a rapidly changing landscape by quickly learning and mastering new skills.

Considering Unboxed Technologies' "Skill Agility," a flurry of game concepts arose. However, one idea consistently stood out: a dynamic, arcade-style game where the player's abilities were in constant flux, while obstacles and hazards on the screen would be changing as well. This concept wasn't just brimming with the potential for engaging gameplay; it perfectly mirrored the user journey within Unboxed Technologies' training programs – navigating a rapidly evolving professional landscape by quickly learning and mastering new skills.

Driven by this fast-paced synergy between brand and mechanic, the game's development was an agile sprint, completed within a single month (June 2nd to June 23rd). The result is a game I'm particularly proud of, rich with features like voice-over guidance, seamless social sharing integration, and ten distinct skills to dynamically swap and master – all directly reflecting the core tenet of Skill Agility.
