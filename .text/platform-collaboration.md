# Platform Collaboration: Making Web Games Work Seamlessly for You
## With Blue Ocean Brain and RTS Technologies

For over a decade I've specialized in developing web games, so I've seen firsthand the potential the web offers for engaging audiences. While the core accessibility of web content is a huge plus, the digital world of 2025 is full of different platforms and technologies. Organizations today are likely already navigating complex pipelines for various forms of web content, and figuring out how games can fit in with that can be challenging.

One of the great things about web games is their straightforward nature. Often, they can be as simple as a collection of static web files, meaning they can be hosted just about anywhere online. This makes getting your game in front of people quick and easy, without the hurdles of app stores.

While simple games have their place, sometimes you need more â€“ things like leaderboards or analytics to understand how players are engaging. I'm equipped to develop these features solo, but real magic can happen when I'm able to collaborate with your existing team and integrate with your current platform. Instead of focusing solely on the technical side, I prioritize understanding your organization's broader goals and what you already have in place. This allows me to develop web games that not only offer compelling engagement, but also strategically align with your overall digital presence - creating a cohesive experience for your audience.

Successfully adding a web game to your offerings involves more than just the code; it's about working well with your existing teams. I believe in adapting to your team's established workflows, whether that means following your project timelines or using your preferred communication and productivity toolsets. My goal is to be a supportive extension of your in-house expertise, ensuring a smooth, efficient, and aligned development process.

My ongoing partnership with Blue Ocean Brain and RTS Technologies, which has lasted for over seven years, is a great example of this in action. Their development team operates on a clear schedule, and throughout our collaboration, we've made sure our game development integrates seamlessly with their existing flow. We've maintained open communication and regular updates to ensure everyone is on the same page.

What's been particularly valuable is how we've integrated the games directly into their platform. For instance, users who are logged in can earn points within the games, directly utilizing Blue Ocean Brain's existing user engagement system.

Beyond just the games themselves, we've also focused on how it fits into their broader content strategy. The end-screens of the games provide the typical post-game feedback, but they also include helpful links to other daily content on offer, encouraging users to explore more of their platform. This long-term collaboration highlights the power of a well-integrated web game in enhancing user engagement within your existing platform.

Ultimately, my aim is to create engaging web games that not only provide a great experience for your audience but also integrate seamlessly with your existing platform and workflows. By focusing on clear communication, respecting your team's processes, and strategically leveraging your current systems, I'm here to be a reliable partner in bringing your interactive ideas to life.
